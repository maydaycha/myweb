It just need some explanation. It needs to use the graphics library attached in the file. \r\n\r\nThe first file contains the geographic boundaries of Iowa in a csv file. In addition, the other file contains election results from Iowa. The geographic boundaries allows us to create a Polygon for each county. The election results will allow you to determine the color that you will fill each Polygon. (red= republican, blue = democrats) Once the Polygon and the color is determined, I have to draw that polygon on the screen. \r\n\r\nFor example, if we look at geographic boundaries in Hancock, Iowa in the first file, we can see the boundaries are Hancock,IA,-93.9702,43.255222,-93.49733,43.255436,-93.498421,42.908478,-93.971352,42.90773\r\nTo create a polygon that represents Hancock: \r\n\r\npoints = [Point(-93.9702,43.255222), Point(-93.49733,43.255436), Point(-93.498421,42.908478), Point(-93.971352,42.90773)]\r\nboundary = Polygon(points)\r\n\r\nFor each boundary points for every county, I need to convert the line of text into a polygon and represent the entire state by storing a list of each of the county polygons that make up the state. \r\n\r\nThe second file contains the election results in Iowa. Each line contains the name of county, state, # votes for Republican , # votes for Democrats, and # of votes for other candidates, in order. With this, I would need to create a list of lists of the election results for each county in Iowa.\r\n\r\nThen, I need to combine the data sources so that the polygon is colored accordingly (red=if republican had more votes, blue=if democrats had more votes) The files are kept in the same order meaning that the polygon for Hancock county will be the 41st polygon in the list of polygons in Iowa and the voting results for Hancock will ALSO be the 41st entry in the list of election result. In other words, the indexes for the list of polygon is the same with the indexes in the results. However, there\'s also something else that needs to be added:\r\n\r\nthe user must be able to specify whether they want to see Iowa counties colored either red, blue, or green(if the third party other than democrats, republicans win) or if they want to see the shade the counties according to the percentage of the vote for each candidate using the color_rgb function to generate the color for that county: \r\ntotal = republican + democrat + other\r\ncolor= color_rgb(255*republican/total, 255*other/total, 255*democrat/total)\r\n\r\nThe program should be simple, with multiple functions with a good top-down design.', '2014-04-03 03:17:27', 'freelancer', 'Python Help', 5725173, 1, '2014-04-03 03:17:27', 'Computer Graphics, Python', '2014-03-29 11:17:36', 'http://www.freelancer.com/projects/Python-computer-graphics/Python-Help.html')

The more the merrier, but hopefully working with people you know and trust and who can help you out of a bind that myself or my co-worker can\'t (and somehow, *gasp* Google can\'t help with either) will make reaching that 2 week deadline easier.\r\n\r\n-- Price negotiable, but you may be paid in crypto-currency or cash, and probably in the long term (I\'m a broke college student who happens to work for a new company that doesn\'t have that much cash flow). Please note that you will be receiving as much help as you wish on the project, to the point where you\'re role may be purely instructional if you wish it, with 2 others doing the coding and testing.

I spend 3 weeks in London and Liverpool and I visited a lot of places of interest such as Natural History Museum, Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace. Liverpool was a great place for understanding the culture and of course it’s the home of the Beatles.\n•	I hired a car and visited Cotswold, absolutely beautiful. But there is also other place to visit, such as the county of Kent which is known as the garden of England. It’s very beautiful and it’s only a short distance from central London. \n\n\nOur main focus is tourist attractions/Towns and cities. \n', '2014-04-04 13:35:46', 'freelancer', 'Tourism content writing - open to bidding', 5732374, 6, 'Advertising, Article Rewriting, English (UK), French, Translation', '2014-03-28 13:35:46', '2014-03-29 18:41:37', 'http://www.freelancer.com/projects/Advertising-Article-Rewriting/Tourism-content-writing-open-bidding.html')[0m

The more the merrier, but hopefully working with people you know and trust and who can help you out of a bind that myself or my co-worker can\'t (and somehow, *gasp* Google can\'t help with either) will make reaching that 2 week deadline easier.\r\n\r\n-- Price negotiable, but you may be paid in crypto-currency or cash, and probably in the long term (I\'m a broke college student who happens to work for a new company that doesn\'t have that much cash flow). Please note that you will be receiving as much help as you wish on the project, to the point where you\'re role may be purely instructional if you wish it, with 2 others doing the coding and testing.

Stage 2 is translating the language file of our Mac Application and it\'s built in help page.\r\nProgrammatically the count is approximately 4,800 English words but this may change slightly (up or down) due to tweaks and changes.\r\n\r\nOnce the translations are complete, we\'ll build them into the product and you\'ll need to spot test for things such as cut off text or overlaps.\r\nSome translated strings may need to be tweaked if there is not enough space on the UI for the original version.\r\nYou will need to have access to an Intel based Macintosh running OS 10.7 or above (preferably 10.9) for this collaboration.\r\n\r\nPlease explain your relevant experience and provide links to any previous translation projects, or if you have none then please translate the following text as a trial and send it along with your bid:\r\n\"Duplicate File Finder helps you regain disk space and reduce clutter by searching for files with identical content, irrespective of location or filename.
